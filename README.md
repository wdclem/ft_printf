# ft_printf

Exercice to recreate the printf function, taking onbaord a few of its functionality.

Try different methodology and deicide to keep it straight forward.
Possible improvement possible for the float if using math.h, which would help further to implement more rounding algo.


Nice practice to deal with all the possible combination possible, really challenging on the organisation side.

Some nice documentation that came across :

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/format-specification-syntax-printf-and-wprintf-functions?view=msvc-170#type
https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html
https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf

Tests can be find in the other branch, probably few things to clean up, unnecessary checks or usage (join instead of dup)
