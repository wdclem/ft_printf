# ft_printf

Exercice to recreate the printf function, taking onbaord a few of its functionality.

The printf is used to display formatted output on the screen or write it to a file.
I choose to reimplement those specifiers :

c,s,p,d,i,u,o,x,X,f with the flags 0,#,'',+,-,hh,ll,l,h,L width and precision are also covered

## Usage :

```
https://github.com/wdclem/ft_printf.git
```

make in the root in the root of the directory.
Compile with any main of your own replace the classice printf with ft_printf.

 
Nice practice to deal with all the possible combination possible, really challenging on the organisation side.

Some nice documentation that came across :
